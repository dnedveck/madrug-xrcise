## Problem setup

A coworker wants to see some summaries of a large dataset: numbers of observations from treatments that match cutoffs. I want to go one better and give her the summaries, but also the subsets of the data that correspond to the observations that made it past the cutoffs. 

She works in Excel for data exploration, so I'm going to package up the summary and the subsets into a single Excel workbook, with the summary and data subsets existing on a different sheet. 

*Note: I need to spend some time teaching her how to use Excel more effectively by shaping the data in forms that makes it easy to manipulate and summarize.*

## Data generation

I work for Dupont and the data is private. So let's generate some data. 

Small batch, handcrafted.

![](assets/woodworking-plane.jpg)

Aspects of the data:

- 3 treatments
- 3 timepoints per trt
- log2fc
- adjusted p value


Let's pretend:

- treatment A is same across all timepoints, and has significant differences
- treatment B is the same across all timepoints, but doesn't really have significant differences
- treatment C has an increased log2fc, and more siginificant diffs across time. 

All compared to a standard control treatment, so we'll just leave that out of the table. 

And let's make some functions to generate these data:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
GenerateTreatmentA <- function(n_per_tp = 100){
  ...
}
```

Wait, let's abstract this even more to make a function that generates data at the timepoint level ... I can then apply over a table to generate the data

```{r}
GenerateTimepoint <- function(n, trt, timep, lfc_sd, pterm){
  pvals <- runif(n, min = 0, max = (1 - pterm))
  lfcs <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = lfc_sd)
  
  return(tibble(gene_id = paste0("gene", 1:n),
                trt = trt,
                timep = timep,
                log2fc = lfcs,
                padj = pvals))
}
```

Ok, make the table to describe the trts, timepoints:
```{r}
exp_design <- bind_rows(
tibble(trt = "A",
           timep = 1:3,
           lfc_sd = 3,
           pterm = .5),
tibble(trt = "B",
           timep = 1:3,
           lfc_sd = 3,
           pterm = 0),
tibble(trt = "C",
           timep = 1:3,
           lfc_sd = 3:5,
           pterm = c(.5, .7, .9))
)
exp_design
```

And let's make the data:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this breaks
diffexpr <- apply(exp_design, 1, function(x){
  GenerateTimepoint(n = 300,
                    trt = x["trt"],
                    timep = x["timep"],
                    lfc_sd = x["lfc_sd"],
                    pterm = x["pterm"])
})
```

```{r}
# this is why we can't have nice things
apply(exp_design, 1, function(x){
  str(x)
})
```

Spending way too much time on the data creation .... so... I'll just use a `for` loop D:

```{r}
# reproducibly random
set.seed(333)

catch <- list()
for(i in seq_along(exp_design$trt)){
  catch[[i]] <- GenerateTimepoint(n = 2000,
                                  trt = exp_design$trt[i],
                                  timep = exp_design$timep[i],
                                  lfc_sd = exp_design$lfc_sd[i],
                                  pterm = exp_design$pterm[i])
}
diff_expr <- bind_rows(catch)
```

## Working with the data


So here is a summary of the total number of differentially expressed genes:

```{r}
diff_expr %>% filter(abs(log2fc) >= 1.5,
                         padj < 0.05) %>% 
  group_by(trt, timep) %>% 
  summarize(DEGs = n())
```


My coworker was interested in seeing the summaries of the differentially expressed genes depending on different l2fc cutoffs. In retrospect I should have sat down with her to figure out the best cutoff for the data (either based on histograms or levels that one cares about) ...

I also was thinking that I can do one better: not only give the summaries, but also give the subsets of the genes, so she could explore the genes. 

Enter `writexl`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("writexl")
```

I'll want to make the following:

- first sheet with a summary
- each sheet corresponding to a comparison / timepoint.

> To write multiple sheets, use a list of named data frames

Nice.

```{r}
WriteSummaryXLSX <- function(dexp, log2fc_cut, adj_pval_cut, xlsxname){
  # dexp is the differential expression table
  
  deg_summary <- dexp %>% filter(abs(log2fc) >= log2fc_cut,
                         padj < adj_pval_cut) %>% 
    group_by(trt, timep) %>% 
  summarize(DEGs = n())
  
  compar.ls <- dexp %>% filter(abs(log2fc) >= log2fc_cut,
                         padj < adj_pval_cut) %>%
    mutate(comparison = paste0(trt, "_", timep)) %>%
    arrange(comparison) %>%
    split(., f = .$comparison)
  
  c(list(summary = deg_summary), compar.ls) %>% 
    writexl::write_xlsx(., xlsxname)
  
}
```

```{r}
WriteSummaryXLSX(diff_expr,
                 log2fc_cut = 1.5,
                 adj_pval_cut = 0.05,
                 "~/tmp/test.xlsx")
```




And this is what I actually used:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
WriteSummaryXLSX <- function(dexp, log2fc_cut, adj_pval_cut, xlsxname){
  # dexp is the differential expression table
  
  deg_summary <- dexp %>% filter(abs(log2fc) >= log2fc_cut,
                         adj_pval < adj_pval_cut,
                         de_denom == "control") %>% 
    group_by(comparison) %>% 
  summarize(DEGs = n())
  
  compar.ls <- dexp %>% filter(abs(log2fc) >= log2fc_cut,
                         adj_pval < adj_pval_cut,
                         de_denom == "control") %>% 
    left_join(., 
              gene_metadata %>%
                select(gene_id, func_anno_atcc, func_anno_bi26)
              ) %>% 
    select(gene_id:adj_pval, func_anno_atcc:func_anno_bi26) %>% 
    arrange(comparison) %>% 
    split(., f = .$comparison)
  
  c(list(summary = deg_summary), compar.ls) %>% 
    writexl::write_xlsx(., xlsxname)
  
}
```



## A moment of pause

Did I really need to separate the DEGs into sheets? No -- I think she would have preferred to work with all of them in the same sheet. But at least I can work with saving to Excel sheets, so that's neat.
